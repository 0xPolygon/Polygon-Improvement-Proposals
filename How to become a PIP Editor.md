## How to become a PIP Editor 

Polygon Improvement Proposals (PIPs) are how the Polygon community decides to upgrade or make changes to the protocols. PIP Editors have extra permissions in the PIP repository in exchange for extra responsibilities within the Polygon community.

Responsibilities as an PIP Editor include:

- Making sure PIPs are well-formatted and technically complete.
- Working with authors to get new PIPs into the repo and assisting them in submitting PullRequests.
- Ensuring PIPs submitted are related to Polygon protocols and follow the PIP standards defined by the ecosystem community.
- Gather consensus on and merge submitted PIPs.
