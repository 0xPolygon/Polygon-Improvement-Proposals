# Polygon Proposals Management Repository 

This repository is used for the management of various initiatives affecting the different Polygon protocols. The main use of this repository is for the Builders meetings, but it is also used for other meetings/discussions related to Polygon protocols.

## Polygon Builder Sessions

This repository is used by the Polygon community to manage various initiatives related to various Polygon protocols. This information can be used at Builders' meetings and other forum for discussion of Polygon protocols.

### Purpose

The Polygon Builder Sessions is a technical call intended to bring together various core Polygon Labs’ developers who help coordinate with the community to  help determine the direction of the protocol. Polygon Labs’ Governance, Validator support, PoS and Research teams provide updates on their projects, discuss various PIPs to improve the protocol, and support each other as we build Web 3.0.

### Agendas

The agendas for the calls are tracked in the [Agenda folder](https://github.com/maticnetwork/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/tree/main/Project%20Management/Agenda) this repository. To add an item to an agenda, please [send a PR to the Agenda folder in this repo](https://github.com/maticnetwork/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/tree/main/Project%20Management/Agenda) which mentions the topic you want to discuss and links any relevant materials (PIPs, prototypes, etc.). 

Anyone is welcome to add an item to the agenda as long as it follows these guidelines:

- The topic is technical in nature.
- The topic involves the Polygon protocol at a low-level. This means Dapps and PRCs are generally not allowed as topics.
- The topic should ideally not be philosophical in nature. The core developer meetings are not meant to decide philosophical or contentious issues that should be decided by the community. There are exceptions to this, but generally these topics distract from more productive technical discussion.

### Who Can Attend

Protocol developers, client developers, network Validators and core Polygon Labs’ researchers, community members (e.g., dApp and ecosystem community members) are invited to attend the sessions. Sometimes a non-core developer with particular expertise on a topic is invited on to discuss a specific agenda item. If you feel you would contribute to the meetings by your attendance please reach out to [Harry Rook](mailto:hrook@polygon.technology).

### Who Manages the Sessions

The sessions are facilitated by Jackson Lewis. The meetings are recorded and transcribed. The transcripts, meeting minutes and video will be uploaded after the completion of the meetings in this public repository.

The sessions are independent of any organization. However, participants in the meetings may also be Polygon Labs' employees.
