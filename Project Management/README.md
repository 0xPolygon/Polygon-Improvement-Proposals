## Polygon Protocol Governance Call

This repository is used by the Polygon community to manage various initiatives related to Polygon protocols, including the Polygon Protocol Governance Calls.

The Polygon Protocol Governance Call is a technical call intended to bring together the technical Polygon community to help determine the direction of the protocol. Infrastructure providers, dapps, developers, validators, as well as Polygon Labs’ Governance, Validator support, PoS, and Research teams, discuss various PIPs to improve the protocol and work with each other as we build the Internet of Value.

### Agendas

The agendas for the calls are tracked in the [Agenda folder](https://github.com/maticnetwork/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/tree/main/Project%20Management/Agenda) of this repository. To add an item to the agenda, please [send a PR to the Agenda folder](https://github.com/maticnetwork/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/tree/main/Project%20Management/Agenda) which lays out the topic you want to discuss, alongside any relevant materials (PIPs, prototypes, etc.). 

Anyone is welcome to add an item to the agenda following the guidelines:

- The topic is technical in nature.
- The topic involves the Polygon protocol at a low level of consideration. This means, for example, that Dapps and PRCs are generally not allowed as topics.
- The topic should be laser-focused. The core developer meetings are not meant to decide philosophical or contentious issues that are decided by the community. There are exceptions to this, but generally, these topics distract from productive technical discussion.

### Who Can Attend

Protocol developers, client developers, network Validators, core Polygon Labs’ researchers, and community members (e.g., dApp and ecosystem community members) are invited to attend the calls. Sometimes a non-core developer with particular expertise on a topic is invited to discuss a specific agenda item. If you feel you would contribute to the meetings by your attendance, please reach out to [Harry Rook](mailto:hrook@polygon.technology).

### Who Manages the Calls

The calls are facilitated by Harry Rook. The meetings are recorded and transcribed. The transcripts and video will be uploaded after the meeting in this repository.

The calls are independent of any organization. However, participants in the meetings may also be Polygon Labs' employees.
